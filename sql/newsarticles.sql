What does this mean for Blueshell? Well, it means this is your chance to already get a bit of the holiday feeling and relax at a few of our activities (hint: sign-up can happen somewhere here at the site). Moreover, we hope that at the end of this month, we can announce the first candidate board for Blueshell! These will take over the reins after the summer holidays, and all of the members can expect an invite for the official Blueshell GMM (general members meeting).</p>
<p>But let’s not look too far forward, there is still plenty to do. We as a board are still interested in looking to improve the Discord (our main communication channel), and we are glad a few members have offered their help, seeing as the board is not exactly ‘’experienced’’ with this wonderful platform. Moreover, there are still plenty of ideas we would like to take up, so don’t be surprised when you see some brand new idea announcements on the Discord! Moreover, don’t forget Blueshell runs on its members – don’t hesistate to contact us to start organizing something, and when you think about starting up a solo game of LoL or climb the ladder in Hearthstone, ask in the channel if anyone is up for some fun! We wish you all the best in these last few weeks of the year, good luck with your studies, and take (a deserved) break of those same studies to come to our activities. </p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

Moreover, where other associations may struggle to find a candidate board, we immeadiately had some members jump at the opportunity, and ended up with five enthusaistic gamers that will carry on (and create) Blueshell’s legacy:</p>
<p><em>Jasper van Harten as Chairman</em></p>

<p>Don’t worry you won’t see us again till next year! While our (local) activities might not be as regular as normally, the summer holidays are an excellent opportunity to make some new friends! So hop on our Discord, ask around a bit for people to play with and jump into a game with a fellow student you didn’t know before!</p>

  <img src="https://esa-blueshell.nl/api/download/willow1.jpg" class="ma-4"
       style="max-width: 40%;float: right" alt="Cosplay photo"/>
  <p class="body-1">From Illidan Stormrage to Mewtwo, with full-body suits and gigantic props, she
    does it all.
    Willow is a professional cosplayer, someone who has dedicated their entire life to the arts
    and crafts of cosplay: a performance art in which people dress up as their favorite characters
    from games, movies, or comics. She lives in Enschede and runs her own cosplay business called
    Willow Creative. With no less than 96.000 followers on Instagram, she makes a big impact in
    the cosplay world with her creative outfits.
  </p>


  <p class="text-h5">Who is Willow?</p>
  <p class="body-1">
    I am Merel Eisink, 28 years old and I live in Enschede and I am a professional cosplayer. I
    sell cosplay accessories such as masks or costumes. I started this venture three years ago
    with my own company Willow Creative.
  </p>
  <p class="body-1">
    When I was 20 years old, I studied Creative Media and Game Technologies at HBO Saxion
    Hogeschool Enschede. During my study time, I was already involved in cosplay, gaming and was a
    huge fan of League of Legends. I chose this study based on my hobbies and interests (cosplay
    and gaming).
  </p>
  <p class="body-1">
    During my study, I had a small side hustle where I 3D-printed my own designed masks. I posted
    it online and people liked my cosplay, how they are being built or how the design processes
    are done. They can see how their favorite game characters are coming to life, from 3D
    sketching towards a realistic and physical design.
  </p>
  <p class="quote">
    "I am really trying to bring the fantasy of the game and characters into our reality."
  </p>
  <p class="body-1">
    You also learn how to develop and design a game with my study, but that was a bit superficial:
    everything is either a big flat screen or in code. With cosplay, you can do more than only
    visual design on-screen: moving parts, LED lights, and robotics. I am really trying to bring
    the fantasy of the game into our reality. This is probably the most fun and challenging aspect
    of cosplay.
  </p>


  <p class="text-h5">What kinds of techniques do you use to create your cosplays?</p>
  <p class="body-1">
    My toolkit has grown over the last couple of years. Obviously, in the beginning, you only have
    a precision knife, glue, and some paper material. Nowadays, I have multiple 3D printers to
    create my work. I also got a laser cutter that I use for cutting foam or vinyl more easily. I
    make my own 2D and 3D patterns for sewing and cutting.
  </p>
  <p class="quote">
    "I created my entire body in 3D so I can easily make cosplay for myself."
  </p>
  <p class="body-1">
    One technique that I myself have created for creating my cosplays, is that I created my entire
    body in 3D so that I can easily make cosplay for myself. Normally, you take scissors and try
    to cut cloth and material until it fits. Now I can do this all digitally. This saves more time
    for me to create new designs or cosplays.
  </p>


  <p class="text-h5">How did you make cosplaying your profession and what were the obstacles?</p>

  <img src="https://esa-blueshell.nl/api/download/willow2.jpg" class="ma-4"
       style="max-width: 40%;float: left" alt="Cosplay photo"/>
  <p class="body-1">
    While I was studying at Saxion, some people were interested in my cosplay
    props via friends or social media. Back then, I made a pistol from D.Va from Overwatch for
    someone. I discovered through my study that I enjoyed making physical props rather than
    becoming a game designer. I also like to work on my own.
  </p>
  <p class="body-1">
    One big obstacle to going professional is the time investment in tailor-made props. Once you
    spend a lot of time on the designing and prototyping of such props, you only made it for one
    person, which is economically inefficient.
  </p>
  <p class="body-1">
    With the advent of 3D printing machines, I can now easily design horns and masks and sell them
    en masse. I sell hundreds of them every year. This made me decide to make my hobby a full-time
    job.
  </p>

  <p class="text-h5">What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a cosplayer?</p>
  <p class="body-1">
    Before corona, I would attend conventions once or twice a month. There are a lot of
    disadvantages when you are wearing big and bulky cosplay. Dragging along all the equipment all
    day long is a hassle. Also, visitors that don’t know how to behave near cosplay outfits,
    thinking that they are allowed to touch our costumes or don’t know some parts are vulnerable.
  </p>
  <p class="quote">
    "I sometimes make props for gaming companies such as Jagex (Runescape), Blizzard (World of
    Warcraft), and Riot Games (League of Legends)."
  </p>
  <p class="body-1">
    Connecting with other people on the internet with a passion for cosplay is also really fun and
    great. With that exposure, lots of big companies are contacting me for promotion campaigns and
    to sponsor products. I sometimes make props for gaming companies such as Jagex (Runescape),
    Blizzard (World of Warcraft). Also, doing this work individually offers me the freedom that I
    like. I mostly have three or four projects running at the same time, picking up projects
    whenever I feel like it.
  </p>

  <p class="text-h5">What is your favorite type of costume to create? </p>
  <p class="body-1">
    It’s hard to say because I like to craft or create something new. If I am making the same sort
    of body armor or pauldrons, then the fun’s gone. I prefer always designing something new. It
    can be anything: wings, suits, etc. Sometimes I stick to one aspect, but after a few versions
    or variations, I will challenge myself and look towards other new components that I can make.
